Today has, in theory, been a day off. I am going to try to be sensible and spend Sundays not at the house, because I don't think 
it is actually realistic to say that I am capable of spending time in the midst of DIY needing doing and to not do something
towards it. Instead, apart from church, I have tried to have a quiet day, and even read a good book (Jacqueline Winspear, Journey 
To Munich, in case anyone is interested!). But I have discovered that age old thing, that knowing that I have a project to do, means
that I have been thinking about it a lot. I am going to have to get back into the habit of being organised, rather than taking three
hours pottering over very little. 
So, I have drawn up a proper list of what we want people to do in and on the house, so that I can give written papers to people
to quote for the work. And, depending upon the prices we get back from the other builders, I may end up project managing it all myself
and engaging separate trades for the different roles. I'd rather not do that, as I realise I am not as experienced at that as I would 
like. I can do all the inside supervising, but I am not 100% certain about the external work. But I am a quick reader and a quick learner
and have time on my hands, so I'll get there if needed.
However, what I promised today was photographs, so hopefully some will appear here now:

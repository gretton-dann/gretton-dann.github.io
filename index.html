<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Welcome to random thunks and photographs</H1>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><BR><BR>So far, this website has been used for
photographs only - I keep having cunning ideas about putting useful
things that I've learned on here, but once I've learned it, I'm
usually off trying to learn something else - not very good at the
hanging round and contemplating what I've learned option, but never
mind - I will try to put other things on here that people might find
useful.</P>

are a variety of different photographs online - all the new ones have
been nicely setup with a program called <A HREF="http://www.digikam.org/">DigiKam</A></P>

This is another example of a room that has gone from looking reasonable to looking absolutely dreadful, as we had to take the fake wood panelling off for the electricians, to starting to look reasonable again (it&apos;s still got a long way to go, and the people who put in the fitted kitchen should be shot - we&apos;ll replace it one day when we can afford it!)<br>

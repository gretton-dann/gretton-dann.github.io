			<h1>Progress so far...</h1></center>
			Well, I don't know about anyone else, but this has been driving me up the wall - I can't bear having to keep clicking on links and then having to go back and remember where in the list I was before and try to follow it all.  So, I'm going to try to put some small photographs in each page, so you can see the progress of all the different rooms...  Apologies for those of you on slow links for whom this takes a long time to download<br>  Additional apologies for the fuzziness of some of the photographs - I think I just get too excited/impatient with cameras, so will have to endeavour to slow down a bit.  (At some point, I might even buy my own digital camera too!!)<br>
			
			We've now had my parents visit as well as all the help from Matt's dad, and managed to get lots of tidying done in the garden, and Matt and my dad have built a shed, and mum's managed to put some well-needed order into everything, especially the kitchen cupboards (after dad rebuilt one of them <b>three</b> times to make it strong enough - every time he thought he'd finished, I start putting stuff back, and it collapsed again!)</br>
			I got fed up and painted the kitchen walls, so they're now only one colour, even if they are lumpy and needing sanding...
			And the bathroom is almost finished - we need to finish the wood and buy some lino and the first room is sorted - hoorah :o) <br>
			(Incidentally, this page was last updated on 13th February 2005, so if you're looking here to see if there's an update, well, if you've already looked since then - erm, no!)

This is the photograph used by the estate agent when we were buying the place - not much has changed here, though at various points, it's actually been messier, what with the 3 skips full of rubbish we've got rid of.<br>

<h2> Kitchen</h2>
Well, cupboards have been dismantled, some have been dismantled and re-mantled, others have been cannibalised, and all our stuff has been put into some sort of order by the woman who can - oh, and I got fed up with the horrible walls and painted them all white - really badly!<br>

<h2> livingroom</h2>
The living room - well, apart from me getting thoroughly fed up with the walls (as in the kitchen) and painting one white (it needs so much more!), we've not done much, except the overload of furniture!  However, the tools have been moved, and the radiator has been painted a lovely white colour - it looks SO much better :o)  And we've got to get a piano in here yet, which will be amusing(!)

<IMG SRC="http://www.judedann.f2s.com/House/16thNov04/pictures/lr1.jpg">the tool centre...<br>
<IMG SRC="./8thJan05/lr3.jpg"><br> There's definitely lots more furniture(!) - and can you see that white radiator - smug, warm feeling!

<h2>bathroom</h2>
<p></p>Well, the bathroom has been the first room we've really decided to go for - and it's definitely getting there.  It's been painted - several times, as I made the silly mistake of trusting a colour chart, and ended up with an even more hideous orange than that in the second bedroom!  Well, it gave me a chance to experiment with some stencils, and it's a rather nice colour now!  Hopefully, I'll finish the skirting board this week, and touch up the paint where I missed bits, and then all that's needed is the lino (we haven't decided whether we're going to be brave and do it all ourselves, or if we're going to find a nice man to do it for us!)</p>  And we've definitely had enough of sanding, so all our other doors are going to be dipped and stripped properly - as soon as we can find someone round here to do it - they seem to be in short supply round here!!!
<IMG SRC="http://www.judedann.f2s.com/House/16thNov04/pictures/bath1.jpg">paint stripping - 6 layers plus varnish, but it's nice wood underneath!!!</IMG><br>
<IMG SRC="http://www.judedann.f2s.com/House/16thNov04/pictures/bath2.jpg">hmm, the door - it WILL look good!!!</IMG><br>

<h2>garden and back of house</h2>
<p>Well, lots of weeding, cutting and chucking later - we've got rid of dreadful sheds, and Matt and my dad have built a funky new one, which still stinks of creosote!  Mum cut down all our trees, and if anyone fancies lots of work, we need all the roots digging out... (well, I can but try!!)  My cat is learning to be happy in the garden (which means I'll have to protect all my seedlings, but that's better than emptying a litter tray!!!)  And there's cardboard all over the flower beds to ensure no weed grow before I get a chance to plant all sorts of things!</p>

			<h1>Stage One - after 2 skips worth of rubbish have been taken out</h1>
			and for those of you who don't already know, the random bloke in these pictures is my father-in-law, who has spent this week doing sterling work and being my taxi driver whilst I worked out what I wanted from various DIY shops!<br>
			
			So far - we've removed all the carpets, and almost all the fake wood cladding from EVERYWHERE downstairs.  The rubbish from the garden has almost all gone (another skip is arriving tomorrow!)  I've cleaned the guttering (and don't intend to go up another ladder that height until next year!!!).  Most of the fake fire surround has gone, but we've left the immediate surround as it's probably better than a blank wall, and we want to keep the fire and have proper toasting forks and things...
			Currently, we're waiting for the electricians to rewire, and thus knock great big holes in the walls, so other than sanding walls and wood down, we're not able to do much till after that...

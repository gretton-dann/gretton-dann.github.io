<p>Right, well, with the feeling that this house is never going to get finished (and the lovely gift
of a digital camera from my sister and her husband), I've decided to do a page per room so that when
I get fed up with feeling that we're not getting anywhere, I can come and look at the photographs
and see how far we have got.  At the moment, I can't get comments to work in the web page creation, without adding them manually, so you get to look at all the photographs without me wittering in the background.  Enjoy, and feel free to join us on a painting/DIY weekend sometime!</p>

To be honest, the exterior of the house hasn&apos;t seen much in the way of change so far.  Lots of rubbish has been removed, and NTL boxes and cables have been sorted, but it really needs the driveway to be dug up and re-done.  The rest of the exterior could do with the windows being replaced/repaired, and the front and back door need stripping and repainting, but nothing is falling apart, so it won&apos;t happen for a while yet.  We might get some bike racks in the front, hopefully some window baskets, and possibly a bin store too - Matt wants to experiment with bricks and mortar.<br>

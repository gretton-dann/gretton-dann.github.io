So far, this website has been used for
photographs only - I keep having cunning ideas about putting useful
things that I've learned on here, but once I've learned it, I'm
usually off trying to learn something else - not very good at the
hanging round and contemplating what I've learned option, but never
mind - I will try to put other things on here that people might find
useful.

Alternatively, Matt will just provide useful links to things only the
Gretton-Danns can use: [Gretton-Dann Useful Links](./links/).


# Photograph Albums

Jude's acquired a digital camera and has gone all arty! So there
are a variety of different photographs online - all the new ones have
been nicely setup with a program called [DigiKam](http://www.digikam.org/)

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>A New House Project</H1>
<p>For those who are interested, and mainly for my own sanity, so I can see that there is progress being made on the house, even when it feels like it isn', I am going to endeavour to keep the progress on the house documented here, and via my <A HREF="http://thewonderingsofthewanderingfool.blogspot.co.uk/">blog</A>. How long this lasts for, and how frequently it is updated, after the first enthusiastic endeavours, I can not promise, but I will do my best.</P>

<p>Here are the <A HREF="http://www.gretton-dann.org.uk/House_2/index.html">first photos</A>. I would start with first viewing, to see what we had before I began dismantling everything!</p>

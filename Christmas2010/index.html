<center><h1>A Cheat's Round Robin Letter</h1></center><p>

<p>Dear All,</p>

<p>We would like to claim that we are doing a Christmas letter like this because of environmental considerations and say that we're feeling smug and setting an example - but that would
be lying!  We have just been exceptionally bad this year at getting organised for Christmas
and so this is as far as we've got on the Christmas Card writing effort - sorry!</p>
<br>
<p>We would like to say Happy Christmas to everyone and thank you so much for the Christmas cards and wishes that you have sent us so far - we really appreciate them and promise to do better
next year.  We are grateful for our friends and family and their love for us.</p>
<br>
<p>I write this as the snow is finally falling in Cambridge, all these stories of
-10 degrees Celsius and feet of snow bear no resembleance to what we have seen
here.  This has been a disappointment for the boy as he's only managed to make
one snowman. Jude was terribly excited, however, as she got to make her first ever snow angel!!</p>

<p>We're now all on holiday for Christmas.  I finished a hectic couple of months
at work on Thursday evening.  And Simeon finished his first term at pre-school
on Friday.</p>

<p>Simeon has really enjoyed the past term and it is amazing to see how far he
has come in just three months.  (Although we are obviously biased, and others
may have different opinions).  One of the best things I have seen is him making
friends and beginning to interact and play with others - as opposed to just
playing in the same room.</p>

<p>We are having a quiet Christmas and New Year, just visiting Jude's sister in
Doncaster in the week between - weather permitting.  We have plenty of Chocolate Christmas cake if you're in the area and fancy helping us eat some!</p>

<p>We hope you all have a good Christmas and enjoy the snow!</p>

<p>Merry Christmas</p>
<p>With love from</p>
<center><p>Matt, Jude & Simeon.</p>

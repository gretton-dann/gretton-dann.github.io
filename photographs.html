<h2> <a href="./House2.html">House Project 2</a></h2>
<p>Having made mistakes (and hopefully learnt from them) in our first house, we appear to have moved on to another one. I'm not certain which one was in a worse condition at the start, but we shall see how long it takes us to sort this one!</p>

<h2> <a href="./Photographs/Cats/index.html">Our kittens - 2006</a></h2>
<p>Daft animals - but I'm not certain whether that's us or them!</p>

<h2> <a href="./Photographs/Botanics1/index.html">Cambridge Botanic Gardens - Autumn 2004</a></h2>
<p><a href="http://www.botanic.cam.ac.uk/">Cambridge Botanic Gardens</a> are fantastic.  They used to have free entry on a Wednesday morning, which was fantastic, and meant that I could wander there whenever I wanted to. Now, unfortunately, they've stopped that, but it's still beautiful and I keep thinking about getting a pass for the year.</p>

<h2> <a href="./Photographs/snowCambridge/index.html">Cambridge - Winter 2004</a></h2>
<p>Our garden and road in the snow in the winter - this scientist is turning far too arty!</p>

<h2><a href="./House_1/index.html">Our First House</a></h2>
<p>The continuing saga of the DIY jobs - it's improving, and our living room looks so funky now :o) </p>

<h2> <a href="./Photographs/Vienna/index.html">Photographs of Vienna - 2003</a></h2>
<p>Matt's business trip was a good holiday for Jude, and a chance to swoon over the fantastic architecture in Vienna - we have blocks of flats - they definitely have apartments - fantastic stuff!</p>

<h2><a href="./weddingalbum.htm"> Wedding Photographs </a></h2>
<p>Our wedding photographs are still here - unfortunately, these haven't yet been sorted with a decent program - I'll get round to this soon...
And for fun, for those of you who were there, spot yourself in this photograph if you can!<br>

Today wasn't a big house day. Took the wallpaper stripper across to the house, and did 10 minutes manual stripping (found an easy 
wall, so got lots of large chunks off). But then it was time to pick up a hire car. Every couple of months since we've moved to Oxford,
I have a lunch trip to IKEA in Milton Keynes to meet some lovely friends for a chat and a laugh. It was really lovely to be 
able to do this today and share news of the house, and catch up. I was very good and didn't buy anything for the house (I'll save that
for the next trip!). But I did pick up their kitchen brochures :)
I also fitted in a trip to Screwfix, to pick up a rotary wallpaper scorer, which looks like it will be fun to use :)
What I learned from today's IKEA trip though, is not to visit on the last Friday of the month - it was HEAVING! The caf√© attendant
said it was always that way on payday weekend...
In the afternoon, we received the builder's quote - 1.5 times our budget, and that's just for the inside main decoration!!  I've
asked on the nice local newsgroup for other recommended builders, and will be organising other quotations!!
